   <p>he 1965 GT350 was built for the race track, not comfort or ease of driving. A total of 34 race-spec "GT350R" cars were built specifically for competition use under SCCA rules, and the model was the B-Production champion for three straight years.[5] The 1966 GT350 was more comfortable for casual drivers, including a rear seat, optional colors, and an optional automatic transmission. This trend for more options and luxuries continued in the following years, with the cars becoming progressively larger, heavier, and more comfortable, at the cost of their competitiveness. By 1969 Carroll Shelby was no longer involved in the Shelby GT program, and the design was done in-house by Ford, with the 1969 GT350s and GT500s reduced to being largely styling modifications to a stock Mustang.

    The 1965 and 1966 GT350s were delivered from Ford's San Jose Assembly Plant for modification by Shelby, originally in Venice Beach and later at Los Angeles International Airport. San Jose cars carried an "R" in the Ford VIN denoting that facility.[6] The only year that Shelby Mustangs from the 1960s came from another plant was 1968, where they came from New Jersey, "T" in the VIN,[7] and were modified by A.O. Smith.</p>
